## Metadata List
These are items which are created by the geopackaging process.... Needs to have a fieldname for each one, simple/complex and an optional explanation/comment.

JSON? Any suggestions?

Suggestions:
* Conformance Level - The level of comprehensiveness of the geopackaging.
* Classes included?
* Product Specification Name (or other identifier e.g. S-57)
* Topology level (from S-100)
* DataSet List (because you can include more than one). This is the list of names included in the nam field in the individual tables
