marine geopackage

A standardised "container" for marine vector and raster tile data. This encoding is designed, primarily, for IHO electronic navigational chart (ENC) data. This data is currently idstributed encoded in ISO8211, a compact self-describing binary form. It has some facets which make it difficult to distribute in other encodings easily. ENC is now being used outside of the traditional navigation sphere as many of its feature classes make is suitable for other uses. So, in order to expose its feature classes, metadata and underlying topology to a wider set of applications this geopackage format is designed.
